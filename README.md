OOP project
Master branch - works properly

**For a project to function well, you have to do this first:**
- COMMENT FILE PATHS (and add your own) in FORMS & Class Library files
- Create your own branch (Name it however you want) based on master branch, so you don't break the already functioning code
- Feel free to use tester project (Console app, allows you to test new code more easily if needed)
